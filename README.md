# Art-Gallery-Management-System
This project is made keeping in mind that the auction of the arts are done in offline mode. And in these pandemic days it is very difficult to conduct that task as such. So this project makes the auction program fully online and saves a lots of time for the people.
This project has the extensive use of (PHP, MYSQL, JAVASCRIPT, HTML, CSS). All the data of the users are stored in the databse and stored there and all the tasks are as per the general requirements of an auction.
